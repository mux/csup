CVSup was originally written in Modula-3 by
	John Polstra <jdp@polstra.com>.

Csup is a rewrite of CVSup in C.  It has been mostly written by
	Maxime Henrion <mux@FreeBSD.org>.

A few contributors have helped him in his task and they are listed here in
alphabetical order :

	Olivier Houchard <cognet@FreeBSD.org>
	Ulf Lilleengen <lulf@kerneled.org>
	Christoph Mathys <cmathys@bluewin.ch>	(Google SoC Project)

Building & Installing
---------------------

First, in order to build csup, you will need a few dependencies:
  - GNU make
  - flex >= 2.5.19
  - The OpenSSL crypto lib and associated openssl/md5.h header
  - The zlib library and associated zlib.h header

Csup should build and run fine under any *BSD OS (that includes
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFlyBSD), as well as Linux and
Darwin.  It has also been tested successfully on a wide range of
architectures: x86, amd64, sparc64, alpha, ia64, arm and powerpc.
If you have a problem building from source, drop me a mail!

As usual, to build the source code, just run "make".  If you're
running a BSD flavoured system, you will most likely need to run
"gmake" instead, to invoke the GNU make variant instead of the
system one. Once this is done, just run "make install" to install
the csup binary, the cpasswd script and their manual pages.

Be warned however that if the packaging system of your OS knows
about csup, it is certainly better to install it from there rather
than by hand, so that it can then be properly deinstalled.
