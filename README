CVSup was originally written in Modula-3 by John Polstra <jdp@polstra.com>.

Csup is a rewrite of CVSup in C.  It has been mostly written by
Maxime Henrion <mux@FreeBSD.org>.

A few contributors have helped him in his task and they are listed here in
alphabetical order :

Olivier Houchard <cognet@FreeBSD.org>
Ulf Lilleengen <lulf@kerneled.org>
Christoph Mathys <cmathys@bluewin.ch>	(Google Summer of Code Project)


Building & Installing
---------------------

Just run "make".  It should build OK on any *BSD system.  (I'll add a
gmake Makefile some day for Linux and Solaris users).

You can then run "make install" to install csup.  Be warned however that
if the packaging system of your OS knows about csup, it would be better
to install it from there.
