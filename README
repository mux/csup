CVSup was originally written in Modula-3 by
	John Polstra <jdp@polstra.com>.

Csup is a rewrite of CVSup in C.  It has been mostly written by
	Maxime Henrion <mux@FreeBSD.org>.

A few contributors have helped him in his task and they are listed
here in alphabetical order:

	Olivier Houchard <cognet@FreeBSD.org>
	Ulf Lilleengen <lulf@kerneled.org>
	Christoph Mathys <cmathys@bluewin.ch>	(Google SoC Project)

Building & Installing
---------------------

First, in order to build csup, you will need a few dependencies:
  - GNU make
  - flex >= 2.5.19
  - The OpenSSL crypto lib and associated openssl/md5.h header
  - The zlib library and associated zlib.h header

Csup should build and run fine under any *BSD OS (that includes
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFlyBSD), as well as Linux and
Darwin.  It has also been tested successfully on a wide range of
architectures: x86, amd64, sparc64, alpha, ia64, arm and powerpc.
If you have a problem building from source, drop me a mail!

As usual, to build the source code, just run "make".  If you're
running a BSD flavoured system, you will most likely need to run
"gmake" instead, to invoke the GNU make variant instead of the
system one.  If your system ships with a flex version that is not
recent enough, you will need to change the FLEX make variable on
the command line to point at another binary, or the build will fail.

For example, to build csup under FreeBSD, you will need to install
the textproc/flex port as well as the devel/gmake one and use this
command line:

	gmake FLEX=/usr/local/bin/flex

Remember however that csup is shipped with FreeBSD in a way that
doesn't require external dependencies, so you should have no reason
to build csup if you're running FreeBSD.  However, this is likely
to apply to most other BSD-like OSes.

Once the build is done, just can run "make install" to install the
csup binary, the cpasswd script and their manual pages.

Be warned however that if the packaging system of your OS knows
about csup, it is certainly better to install it from there rather
than by hand, so that it can then be properly deinstalled.
