CVSup was originally written in Modula-3 by John Polstra <jdp@polstra.com>.

Csup is a rewrite of CVSup in C.  It has been mostly written by
Maxime Henrion <mux@FreeBSD.org>.

A few contributors have helped him in his task and they are listed here in
alphabetical order :

Olivier Houchard <cognet@FreeBSD.org>
Ulf Lilleengen <lulf@kerneled.org>
Christoph Mathys <cmathys@bluewin.ch>	(Google Summer of Code Project)


Building & Installing
---------------------

Csup should build and run fine under any *BSD OS (that includes FreeBSD,
NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFlyBSD), as well as Linux and Darwin.  If you
have a problem building from source, drop me a mail!

If you're running a *BSD system, you can just run "make" followed by
"make install".  However, if you're a Linux or Darwin user, you need to
use the gmake-specific Makefile, so run "make -f Makefile.gmake", and
then "make -f Makefile.gmake install" to install.

Be warned however that if the packaging system of your OS knows about csup,
it is certainly better to install it from there rather than by hand, so
that it can then be properly deinstalled.
