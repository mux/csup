- Parse, use and update status file.
- Implement zlib compression.
- Implement the diff updating method and possibly the rsync one.  Also,
  update file attributes and not only their content.
- Correctly handle (un)escaping in tokens as described in the
  doc/Protocol file of CVSup : \_ -> space, \t -> tab, \n -> newline,
  \r -> carriage return and \\ -> backslash.
- Always use absolute pathnames and don't use chdir().  Depending on the
  threading library, we may not have a current working directory for each
  thread and it's wrong to rely on it.
- We can't handle lines bigger than STREAM_BUFSIZ at the moment.  This
  could be a problem if people have files with very big lines, which is
  more likely to happen if we are sent binary files.
- Add missing support for supfile keywords and add sanity checks for
  some of them.  Also, we're not supposed to choke on unknown keywords
  to stay in line with CVSup, which just ignores them in order to
  maintain compatibility with sup configuration files.
- Add support for refuse files.
- Add support for authentication.
- Add support for shell commands sent by the server.
- Add missing support for various CVSup options : -A, -k, -l, -1 and -r,
  -s (requires status file support), -z and -Z (requires zlib compression
  support), -d, -i, -a (requires authentication support), -e and -E
  (requires shell commands support) and the destDir parameter.
- If the prefix directory is a symbolic link pointing to a nonexistent
  file named `SKIP', then we should skip the collection, as described in
  the CVSup manual page.
- Cleanup error handling just about everywhere.
- Handle some signals (SIGINT, SIGPIPE and maybe others) gracefully, like
  CVSup does and like we should.
- Properly close the channels at the end of a session.
- Write a manual page (the CVSup one should probably be reused).
- Make the code work on other systems than FreeBSD.  OpenBSD and NetBSD
  support will probably be easy, Linux support will probably require more
  work.  Solaris and Darwin support would also be nice.
- Implement some new useful options : the ability to generate CVS
  checkout files (files in CVS/ subdirectores), a command line override
  to only update a specific collection and a third verbosity level to
  display commit log messages.
- Add support for CVS mode (maybe?).
