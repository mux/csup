BUGS:

- Correctly handle (un)escaping in tokens as described in the
  doc/Protocol file of CVSup : \_ -> space, \t -> tab, \n -> newline,
  \r -> carriage return and \\ -> backslash.  The code is riddled with
  strsep() calls, they need to be isolated and replaced with clean
  parsing interface that handles escaping.
- Cleanup error handling just about everywhere.  For now, the code is
  unable to properly handle failures.  We need the worker threads to
  return an exist status and possible an error message.  The stream API
  needs error numbers too, and a stream_eof() function. In case of an
  error, the updater thread needs to recover gracefully so as to write
  a proper status file.  I probably overlooked a few things.
- Always use absolute pathnames and don't use chdir().  Depending on the
  threading library, we may not have a current working directory for each
  thread and it's wrong to rely on it.
- Some code uses getpwnam() while it should use the thread-safe variant,
  getpwnam_r().  Same for getpwuid() and getgrgid().  We probably need a
  UID/GID lookup cache here.
- Add missing support for supfile keywords and add sanity checks for
  some of them.  Also, we're not supposed to choke on unknown keywords
  to stay in line with CVSup, which just ignores them in order to
  maintain compatibility with sup configuration files.
- If the prefix directory is a symbolic link pointing to a nonexistent
  file named `SKIP', then we should skip the collection, as described in
  the CVSup manual page.
- Handle some signals (SIGINT, SIGPIPE and maybe others) gracefully, like
  CVSup does and like we should.

MISSING FEATURES:

- Parse, use and update status file (ongoing).
- Consider computing the MD5 checksum when updating rather than after the
  diff/checkout is done, it would avoid reading the whole file two times.
- Add support for refuse files.
- Add support for authentication.
- Add support for shell commands sent by the server.
- Add missing support for various CVSup options : -A, -k, -l, -1 and -r,
  -s (requires status file support), -d, -i, -a (requires authentication
  support), -e and -E (requires shell commands support) and the destDir
  parameter.
- Write a manual page (the CVSup one should probably be reused).
- Make the code work on other systems than FreeBSD.  OpenBSD and NetBSD
  support will probably be easy, Linux support will probably require more
  work.  Solaris and Darwin support would also be nice.
- Implement some new useful options : the ability to generate CVS
  checkout files (files in CVS/ subdirectores), a command line override
  to only update a specific collection and a third verbosity level to
  display commit log messages.
- Add support for CVS mode (maybe?).
